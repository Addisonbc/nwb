## Project Description

- convert extracellular electrophysiology data recorded by Plexon recording system to NWB data format
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objectives
- Create a package that will convert .pl2 file, which usually inludes ecephys spike data, LFP data, experiment event data into a full NWB file.
<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

<!-- 1. Objective A. Describe it in 1-2 sentences.-->
<!-- 1. Objective B. Describe it in 1-2 sentences.-->
<!-- 1. ...-->

## Approach and Plan
1. Learn about the basic structure of NWB
2. convert sample session into NWB data
3. Test reading using pyNWB and matNWB
<!-- 1. Describe the steps of your planned approach to reach the objectives.-->
